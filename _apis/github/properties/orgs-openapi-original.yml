        When the value of `two_factor_requirement_enabled` is `true`, the
        organization requires all members, billing managers, and outside
        collaborators to enable [two-factor
        authentication](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/).


        To see the full details about an organization, the authenticated user
        must be an organization owner.


        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
        `admin:org` scope to see the full details about an organization.


        To see information about an organization's GitHub Enterprise Server
        plan, GitHub Apps need the `Organization plan` permission.

        Sets the actions that are allowed in an organization. To use this
        endpoint, the organization permission policy for `allowed_actions` must
        be configured to `selected`. For more information, see "[Set GitHub
        Actions permissions for an
        organization](#set-github-actions-permissions-for-an-organization)."


        If the organization belongs to an enterprise that has `selected` actions
        set at the enterprise level, then you cannot override any of the
        enterprise's allowed actions settings.


        To use the `patterns_allowed` setting for private repositories, the
        organization must belong to an enterprise. If the organization does not
        belong to an enterprise, then the `patterns_allowed` setting only
        applies to public repositories in the organization.


        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic) need the
        `admin:org` scope to use this endpoint.

        **Note**: GitHub's REST API considers every pull request an issue, but
        not every issue is a pull request. For this

        reason, "Issues" endpoints may return both issues and pull requests in
        the response. You can identify pull requests by

        the `pull_request` key. Be aware that the `id` of a pull request
        returned from "Issues" endpoints will be an _issue id_. To find out the
        pull

        request id, use the "[List pull
        requests](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/pulls/pulls#list-pull-requests)"
        endpoint.


        This endpoint supports the following custom media types. For more
        information, see "[Media
        types](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/using-the-rest-api/getting-started-with-the-rest-api#media-types)."


        - **`application/vnd.github.raw+json`**: Returns the raw markdown body.
        Response will include `body`. This is the default if you do not pass any
        specific media type.

        - **`application/vnd.github.text+json`**: Returns a text only
        representation of the markdown body. Response will include `body_text`.

        - **`application/vnd.github.html+json`**: Returns HTML rendered from the
        body's markdown. Response will include `body_html`.

        - **`application/vnd.github.full+json`**: Returns raw, text, and HTML
        representations. Response will include `body`, `body_text`, and
        `body_html`.

      summary: Set organization membership for a user
      description: >-
        Only authenticated organization owners can add a member to the
        organization or update the member's role.


        *   If the authenticated user is _adding_ a member to the organization,
        the invited user will receive an email inviting them to the
        organization. The user's [membership
        status](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/orgs/members#get-organization-membership-for-a-user)
        will be `pending` until they accept the invitation.
            
        *   Authenticated users can _update_ a user's membership by passing the
        `role` parameter. If the authenticated user changes a member's role to
        `admin`, the affected user will receive an email notifying them that
        they've been made an organization owner. If the authenticated user
        changes an owner's role to `member`, no email will be sent.


        **Rate limits**


        To prevent abuse, the authenticated user is limited to 50 organization
        invitations per 24 hour period. If the organization is more than one
        month old or on a paid plan, the limit is 500 invitations per 24 hour
        period.

        You can restore a deleted package under the following conditions:
          - The package was deleted within the last 30 days.
          - The same package namespace and version is still available and not reused for a new package. If the same package namespace is not available, you will not be able to restore your package. In this scenario, to restore the deleted package, you must delete the new package that uses the deleted package's namespace first.

        Each distinct user login across all repositories is counted as a single
        Advanced Security seat, so the `total_advanced_security_committers` is
        not the sum of advanced_security_committers for each repository.


        If this organization defers to an enterprise for billing, the
        `total_advanced_security_committers` returned from the organization API
        may include some users that are in more than one organization, so they
        will only consume a single Advanced Security seat at the enterprise
        level.


        The total number of repositories with committer information is tracked
        by the `total_count` field.

        Adds an organization member to a team. An authenticated organization

        Team synchronization is available for organizations using GitHub
        Enterprise Cloud. For more information, see [GitHub's
        products](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/github/getting-started-with-github/githubs-products)
        in the GitHub Help documentation.


        **Note:** When you have team synchronization set up for a team with your
        organization's identity provider (IdP), you will see an error if you
        attempt to use the API for making changes to the team's membership. If
        you have access to manage group membership in your IdP, you can manage
        GitHub Enterprise Server team membership through your identity provider,
        which automatically adds and removes team members in an organization.
        For more information, see "[Synchronizing teams between your identity
        provider and GitHub Enterprise
        Server](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/articles/synchronizing-teams-between-your-identity-provider-and-github/)."


        An organization owner can add someone who is not part of the team's
        organization to a team. When an organization owner adds someone to a
        team who is not an organization member, this endpoint will send an
        invitation to the person via email. This newly-created membership will
        be in the "pending" state until the person accepts the invitation, at
        which point the membership will transition to the "active" state and the
        user will be added as a member of the team.


        If the user is already a member of the team, this endpoint will update
        the role of the team member's role. To update the membership of a team
        member, the authenticated user must be an organization owner or a team
        maintainer.


        **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using
        the route `PUT
        /organizations/{org_id}/team/{team_id}/memberships/{username}`.

        parent team will also be checked.


        You can also get information about the specified repository, including
        what permissions the team grants on it, by passing the following custom
        [media
        type](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/overview/media-types/)
        via the `application/vnd.github.v3.repository+json` accept header.


        If a team doesn't have permission for the repository, you will receive a
        `404 Not Found` response status.


        If the repository is private, you must have at least `read` permission
        for that repository, and your token must have the `repo` or `admin:org`
        scope. Otherwise, you will receive a `404 Not Found` response status.


        **Note:** You can also specify a team by `org_id` and `team_id` using
        the route `GET

        For OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic), this endpoint
        only lists organizations that your authorization allows you to operate
        on in some way (e.g., you can list teams with `read:org` scope, you can
        publicize your organization membership with `user` scope, etc.).
        Therefore, this API requires at least `user` or `read:org` scope for
        OAuth app tokens and personal access tokens (classic). Requests with
        insufficient scope will receive a `403 Forbidden` response.
