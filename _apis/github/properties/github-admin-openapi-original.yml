        For activity relating to check suites, use the `check-suite` event.


        To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level
        access for the "Checks" repository permission. To receive the
        `rerequested` and `requested_action` event types, the app must have at
        least write-level access for the "Checks" permission. GitHub Apps with

        **Note**: The API only looks for pushes in the repository where the

        For activity relating to check runs, use the `check_run` event.


        To subscribe to this event, a GitHub App must have at least read-level
        access for the "Checks" permission. To receive the `requested` and
        `rerequested` event types, the app must have at least write-level access
        for the "Checks" permission. GitHub Apps with write-level access for the
        "Checks" permission are automatically subscribed to this webhook event.


        Repository and organization webhooks only receive payloads for the
        `completed` event types in repositories.


        **Note**: The API only looks for pushes in the repository where the
        check suite was created. Pushes to a branch in a forked repository are
        not detected and return an empty `pull_requests` array and a `null`

        **Notes**:

        - This event will not occur when more than three tags are created at
        once.

        - Payloads are capped at 25 MB. If an event generates a larger payload,
        GitHub will not deliver a payload for that webhook event. This may
        happen, for example, if many branches or tags are pushed at once. We
        suggest monitoring your payload size to ensure delivery.

      summary: >-
        This event occurs when a user revokes their authorization of a GitHub
        App. For more information, see "[About
        apps](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/developers/apps/getting-started-with-apps/about-apps#about-github-apps)."

        or "[Apps](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/apps)" in
        the REST API documentation.


        A GitHub App receives this webhook by default and cannot unsubscribe
        from this event.


        Anyone can revoke their authorization of a GitHub App from their [GitHub
        account settings page](https://github.com/settings/apps/authorizations).
        Revoking the authorization of a GitHub App does not uninstall the GitHub
        App. You should program your GitHub App so that when it receives this
        webhook, it stops calling the API on behalf of the person who revoked
        the token. If your GitHub App continues to use a revoked access token,
        it will receive the `401 Bad Credentials` error. For details about
        requests with a user access token, which require GitHub App
        authorization, see "[Authenticating with a GitHub App on behalf of a
        user](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/apps/creating-github-apps/authenticating-with-a-github-app/authenticating-with-a-github-app-on-behalf-of-a-user)."
