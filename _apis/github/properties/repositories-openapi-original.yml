        Note:

        - For GitHub Enterprise Server, this endpoint will only list
        repositories available to all users on the enterprise.

        - Pagination is powered exclusively by the `since` parameter. Use the
        [Link
        header](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api#using-link-headers)
        to get the URL for the next page of repositories.

      summary: Search repositories
      description: >-
        Find repositories via various criteria. This method returns up to 100
        results [per
        page](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/guides/using-pagination-in-the-rest-api).


        When searching for repositories, you can get text match metadata for the
        **name** and **description** fields when you pass the `text-match` media
        type. For more details about how to receive highlighted search results,
        see [Text match
        metadata](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/search/search#text-match-metadata).


        For example, if you want to search for popular Tetris repositories
        written in assembly code, your query might look like this:


        `q=tetris+language:assembly&sort=stars&order=desc`


        This query searches for repositories with the word `tetris` in the name,
        the description, or the README. The results are limited to repositories
        where the primary language is assembly. The results are sorted by stars
        in descending order, so that the most popular repositories appear first
        in the search results.

            The query contains one or more search keywords and qualifiers.
            Qualifiers allow you to limit your search to specific areas of
            GitHub Enterprise Server. The REST API supports the same qualifiers
            as the web interface for GitHub Enterprise Server. To learn more
            about the format of the query, see [Constructing a search
            query](https://docs.github.com/enterprise-server@3.9/rest/search/search#constructing-a-search-query).
