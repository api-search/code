        Gets the GitHub Advanced Security active committers for an enterprise
        per repository.


        Each distinct user login across all repositories is counted as a single
        Advanced Security seat, so the `total_advanced_security_committers` is
        not the sum of active_users for each repository.


        The total number of repositories with committer information is tracked
        by the `total_count` field.
